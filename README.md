##### Problem Statement.
<hr>
In the year of 2020 Covid pandemic has came and change the way of classes from offline to online. 
Every institute is trying to deliver its classes through online. 
In online classes most of the teacher use slides to teach the student. 
Here's the student face an problem and that is How to write notes from slides.
<br>
Solution for that is:

- Take screenshot of slides.
- Ask teacher for slides.
  
In solution 1 there is also a problem. 
If a student take screenshot of slides and after 
sometime student decided to revise from screenshots 
then he/she has to find out screenshot in serial 
manner and its tedious task.

In second solution student has to store different 
slides of every lecture.
Changing file to file and reading them breaks 
the concentration of student.
